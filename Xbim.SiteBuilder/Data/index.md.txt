# What is it?

The xBIM Tookit (eXtensible Building Information Modelling) is an open-source, software development BIM toolkit that 
supports the BuildingSmart Data Model (aka the [Industry Foundation Classes IFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes)).

xBIM allows developers to read, create and view [Building Information (BIM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) Models in the IFC format. 
There is full support for geometric, topological operations and visualisation. In addition xBIM supports 
bi-directional translation between IFC and COBie formats

## Getting Started

Our main distribution channel is [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=xbim). Versions published there are assumed to be stable and safe. 
You can also use our development feeds as listed at the bottom of this page. Have a look at [this quick guide](/quick-start.html) to get up to speed
with basic xBIM functions.
 
[XbimEssentials](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimEssentials) is a software library to be used for the creation of complex applications, other repositories under the [XbimTeam](https://github.com/xBimTeam) page include a number of example applications to demonstrate its capabilities

* [XbimXplorer](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimWindowsUI) - a Windows WPF sample application that can open and render 3D IFC models (and native XBIM models ) as well as displaying semantic data.
* [XbimWebUI](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimWebUI) - a web application that can open and render 3D IFC models. 
* [XbimUtilities](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimUtilities) - a set of sample console applications to perform bulk functions on IFC files.
* [XbimExchange ](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange) - Project containing libraries and sample application demonstrating various approaches to work with COBie. This includes [Xbim.Cobie](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange/tree/master/Xbim.COBie) which represents spreadsheet view of the COBie model, [implementation](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange/tree/master/Xbim.COBieLite) of [CobieLite](https://www.nibs.org/?page=bsa_cobielite),  [Xbim.CobieLiteUK](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange/tree/master/Xbim.COBieLiteUK) which is XML model inspired by CobieLite but more rigorous and memory efficient and [CobieExpress](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimEssentials/tree/master/Xbim.CobieExpress) as an EXPRESS based model representing COBie. [XbimExchange ](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange) contains sample code for conversions between IFC and various implementations of COBie.
* [HelloWall](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimSamples) - a sample console application demonstrating how to undertake simple IFC creation with Xbim.

Please note: all the applications are provided to demonstrate how to use the Xbim library, they are not intended for use in uncontrolled production environments.

## Licence

The XBIM library is made available under the [CDDL Open Source licence](/license/license.html). List of third party licenses is [here](/license/third-party-licenses.html).

All licences should support the commercial usage of the XBIM system within a 'Larger Work', as long as you honour 
the licence agreements.


## Compilation

The toolkit uses the Nuget technology for the management of several required packages as well as for distributing the libraries.
If you wish to use the development versions of xBIM make sure to add our NuGet feeds for the master and develop branches of the solution.
Nuget can download all the required dependencies for you if you have the correct package source configuration.

If you use Visual Studio 2015+ add the following package sources:
* https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-develop/api/v3/index.json
* https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-master/api/v3/index.json

If you use Visual Studio 2013+ add the following package sources:
* https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-develop/api/v2
* https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-master/api/v2

The resulting configuration pages looks like this in VS2015:
