# What is it?

The **xBIM Toolkit** (eXtensible Building Information Modelling) is a **.NET** [open-source](/license/license.html) software development BIM toolkit that 
supports the [BuildingSmart](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/) Data Model (aka the [Industry Foundation Classes IFC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes)).

xBIM allows .NET developers to read, create and view [Building Information (BIM)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) Models in the IFC format. 
There is full support for geometric, topological operations and visualisation. In addition xBIM supports 
bi-directional translation between IFC and COBie formats. Core libraries for data manipulation are all written in C#, core of geometry engine is written in C++.

# Getting Started

Our main distribution channel is [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=xbim). Versions published there are assumed to be stable and safe. 
You can also use our development feeds as listed at the bottom of this page. Have a look at [this quick guide](/quick-start.html) to get up to speed
with basic xBIM functions. Examples contain other code samples and snippets which present various xBIM features. You will see that it is quite powerful.
 
Two core libraries [xBIM Essentials](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimEssentials) and [xBIM Geometry](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimGeometry) are to be used 
for the creation of complex applications, other repositories under the [xBIM Team](https://github.com/xBimTeam) page include a number of example applications to 
demonstrate its capabilities:

* [xBIM Xplorer](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimWindowsUI) - a Windows WPF sample application that can open and render 3D IFC models (and native xBIM models ) as well as displaying semantic data.
* [xBIM WebUI](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimWebUI) - a web application that can open and render 3D models [processed by xBIM](/examples/creating-wexbim-file.html). 
* [xBIM Utilities](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimUtilities) - a set of sample console applications to perform bulk functions on IFC files.
* [xBIM Exchange ](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange) - Project containing libraries and sample application demonstrating various approaches to work with COBie. This includes [Xbim.Cobie](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange/tree/master/Xbim.COBie) which represents spreadsheet view of the COBie model, [implementation](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange/tree/master/Xbim.COBieLite) of [CobieLite](https://www.nibs.org/?page=bsa_cobielite),  [Xbim.CobieLiteUK](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange/tree/master/Xbim.COBieLiteUK) which is XML model inspired by CobieLite but more rigorous and memory efficient and [CobieExpress](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimEssentials/tree/master/Xbim.CobieExpress) as an EXPRESS based model representing COBie. [XbimExchange ](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimExchange) contains sample code for conversions between IFC and various implementations of COBie.
* [xBIM Samples](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimSamples) - a sample console application demonstrating how to undertake simple IFC creation and other tasks with xBIM.

Please note: all the applications except for [xBIM WebUI](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimWebUI) are provided to demonstrate how to use the xBIM library, they are not intended for use in uncontrolled production environments.

# Licence

The XBIM library is made available under the [CDDL Open Source licence](/license/license.html). List of third party licenses is [here](/license/third-party-licenses.html).

All licences should support the commercial usage of the xBIM Toolkit within a 'Larger Work', as long as you honour 
the licence agreements.


# Compilation

The toolkit uses the NuGet technology for the management of several required packages as well as for distributing the libraries.
If you wish to use the **development versions of xBIM** make sure to add our NuGet feeds for the master and develop branches of the solution.
NuGet can download all the required dependencies for you if you have the correct package source configuration.

If you use Visual Studio 2015+ add the following package sources:

  - https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-develop/api/v3/index.json
  - https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-master/api/v3/index.json

If you use Visual Studio 2013+ add the following package sources:

  - https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-develop/api/v2
  - https://www.myget.org/F/xbim-master/api/v2


# History

xBIM Toolkit was started by [prof. Steve Lockley](https://github.com/orgs/xBimTeam/people/SteveLockley) in 2007. Steve made it initially as a hobby while on a career break for a year. 
When he joined [Northumbria University](https://www.northumbria.ac.uk/) in 2009 the core of xBIM was already
developed and it implemented most of [IFC2x3](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC2x3/TC1/html/). This means Steve developed the core methodology of mapping between EXPRESS schema
and C#. He also developed the core infrastructure for data management of any IFC model. All this is good to know when you read our [license](/license/license.html);

Steve took xBIM to university with him and since than it is being actively developed mostly as a part of successful [government funded](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk)
research projects with industrial partners mainly from UK. It evolved over time into a lot more than just an implementation
of IFC2x3. Current release supports 100% IFC2x3 and [IFC4](http://www.buildingsmart-tech.org/ifc/IFC4/Add1/html/). We use code generation to keep all the code consistent and complete.
xBIM allows developers to program against IFC2x3 models using IFC4 interfaces so it is possible to develop and maintain single codebase
which is agnostic to the IFC version. You can choose between Esent DB or in-memory model based on your needs. 
We have [geometry engine](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimGeometry) which can process complex IFC geometry and make it usable
for 3D analyses or visualization. We have our own JavaScript library using [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/1.0/)
for visualization on a web without any plug-ins. 
There are also many projects we developed over time which use xBIM core libraries ([xBIM Essentials](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimEssentials) 
and [xBIM Geometry](https://github.com/xBimTeam/XbimGeometry)) for some interesting tasks.

There are about 10 developers in the core of xBIM Team. All of us are keen to keep xBIM ready for enterprise deployment. Part of the
team is based on Northumbria University the rest is spread over enterprises who have adopted xBIM as an engine behind
the BIM related functionality of their products.

Our [GitHub page](https://github.com/orgs/xBimTeam/people) lists public members of the core team. There are other internal
members from the enterprises. If you want to contact us to ask something about xBIM source code we prefer 
[GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) as a way to talk about the code.
