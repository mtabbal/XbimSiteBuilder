Federation of multiple models
=============================

  - Overlaying multiple models to behave like a one
  - Uniform access to the data as if it was a single model
  - Read-only. To modify the content of the model you have to work with the specific model
  - Not constrained to a single schema (federate IFC2x3 + IFC4 → query it as IFC4 interfaces)
  - IFC federation can be stored as an IFC file (in IfcStore)
